Multiple {starlight_rabbitmq} instances can be launched at the same time for scalability and high availability needs.
The {starlight_rabbitmq} instances are stateless and can be started and stopped at will.
They share their configuration in ZooKeeper so you can create, delete, bind, and unbind exchanges and queues on any {starlight_rabbitmq} instance.
The configuration will be synchronized on the other {starlight_rabbitmq} instances.

Publishing messages can be done on any {starlight_rabbitmq} instance.
On the receiving side, messages will be dispatched evenly to all connected AMQP consumers because the Pulsar subscriptions are shared.
