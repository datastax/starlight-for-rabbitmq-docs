Starlight for RabbitMQ exposes the following metrics in Prometheus format. You can monitor your clusters with these metrics.

The following types of metrics are available:

- https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/#counter[Counter]: a cumulative metric that represents a single monotonically increasing counter. The value increases by default. You can reset the value to zero or restart your cluster.
- https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/#gauge[Gauge]: a metric that represents a single numerical value that can arbitrarily go up and down.

== Starlight for RabbitMQ metrics

The Starlight for RabbitMQ metrics are exposed under `/metrics`` at port `8000` along with Pulsar metrics. Use a different port by configuring the `stats_server_port` system property. Depending on where the Starlight for RabbitMQ service is deployed, each metric will be prefixed with either "pulsar_proxy", "pulsar", or "server" (for standalone).
